And the role of Airbnb in that travel community is to be the ultimate host.  Think of us with AI as building the ultimate AI concierge that could understand you."  -Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky

## Overview and Origin

* Airbnb stands for "*Airbed and Breakfast*".

* History

    Airbnb was incorporated in August 2008.
    Publicly traded since December 2020 under **NASDAQ:ABNB**.

* Founders
 
    Three founders: Brian Chesky, Nathan Biecharczyk and Joe Gebbia.  The three were classmates at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).

* Idea conception
 
    According to the company's website, two of the founders were living in San Francisco in 2007.  They noticed that all the hotels were booked due to a conference.  They decided to turn their loft into a bed and breakfast by renting out air matresseses in their living room and offering breakfast.  

* Funding
 
    The company raised over $6 billion in funding before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020.  The IPO raised an additional $3.5 billion.  The company is currently self-funding.  It does not require additional capital to grow.  Airbnb currently (9/13/24) has a market capitalization of $75 billion.

## Business Activities

* Challenge
 
    The company started by offering short-term rentals of spare rooms.  It later expanded to include entire apartments and houses.  It addressed the situations where traditional accomodations such as hotels might be fully booked or too expensive.  Travelers needed affordable and flexible alternatives.

    The company also helps hosts (homeowners) monetize their unused spaces by offering them to guests seeking short-term stays.  This created a two-sided marketplace, solving the demand for short-term lodging and the supply of available, rentable space.  

* Market
 
    Airbnb competes in the global vacation rental market space, which is estimated to be worth $75 billion in 2021.  The company offers a reservation platform for short-term rentals to provide lodging options around the world.  Its service is an alternative to traditional hotels.

* Competitive position
 
    The company has first mover advantage, pioneering this market.  It has the largest platform that connects travelers and property owners.  It benefits from the network effect where having more platform users and lodging alternatives gives a significant competitive advantage.  It has a leading market share in the short-term rental market.  As of 2022, it had over 4 million hosts and 150 million users with listings in over 220 countries.

* Technologies
 
    According to a April 21, 2023 article in Intuji, the platform offers  multiple payment gateways.  The architecture relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The app's backend is built on a combination of Ruby on Rails and Node.js.  The frontend is built on React Native.  

    The software architecture is based on a microservices approach, where the application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  At the core of its architecture is the API Gateway, which provides a single point of entry for all client requests.  

    Machine learning (ML) is important in the Airbnb app, powering its search and recommendation engines.  ML is also used to optimize pricing for hosts.  This is AI-powered pricing technology is referred to internally as "Smart Pricing."

## Landscape

* Field
 
    As an online platform, Airbnb relies on technology to connect hosts and guests.  It is part of the marketplace platform, where users exchange goods or services.  It is a technology company and does not own housing properties.

* Recent trends
 
    The last 5 to 10 years have seen significant technological advances, a shift towards experienced-based travel, the rise of alternative accomodations, and remote working.

* Competitors
 
    The direct competitor is Vrbo, which is owned by Expedia Group.  Vbro focuses on on renting entire properties rather than rooms or shared spaces.  Another direct competitor is Booking.com, which has a wider offering.  For example, it is a major platform for traditional hotels.  Other competitors include TripAdvisor, Marriott Homes & Villas, and Oyo Rooms.

## Results

* Business impact
 
    Airbnb has had a transformative impact on several industries, particularly hospitality, real estate, and tourism.  By developing the rental market in a given city or town, travelers have more choices and different ways to experience new places.  Hosts can earn additional income that would not otherwise be possible.  The city benefits from hotel taxes.  However, there are challenges relating to housing, regulation and community impact.    

* Core metrics and company performance
 
    According to the company's website, "fast facts" or metrics include active listings worldwide, cities and towns with active listings, countries and regions with listings, hosts, hosts earnings and more.  Airbnb has a clear leadership in its market niche.


* Competitive position
 
    Airbnb occupies a strong market niche in short-term rentals offered by individuals.  Direct competitors are becoming increasingly competitive.  The primary competition is from traditional hotel chains that offer one-stop shopping and longer stay packages.

## Recommendations

* New products and services
 
    Airbnb collects an enormous amount of data when a potential traveler enters the platform via the web or app.  The user's search history, current and past, and country of origin can provide great insights.  The traveler and host's reviews of the rental property provide valuable information.  The company has a treasure trove of data to collect and provide insights for additional services.
    
    However, the company basically operates in one vertical, the short-term  rental market.  Many more verticals can be integrated into a future platform.  I agree with Airbnb management's decision to offer Airbnb Concierge, called a lifestyle super-app.  Using advanced AI, the company can offer a more personalized and comprehensive service. 

* Benefits
 
    The company has an ecosystem of travelers and hosts.  The traveler basically books accommodation through Airbnb.  Additional services can be offered such as car rentals, airport pickup, city tours and airfare booking.  It offers the traveler a one-stop shop for all of their vacation needs.  This provides Airbnb with additional revenue sources.  The traveler would be more loyal and become a repeat customer.  This super app will also provide increased revenue opportunities for the host, attracting more property listings.

* Technologies
 
    Leveraging AI, Airbnb Concierge will deliver highly personalized recommendations and services across its expanded offerings.  Through AI decision making, the company learns more about its travelers.  The company also needs to strengthen its infrastructure with increased server capacity and data processing.

* Appropriateness
 
    The millions of daily users on its platform and the data that is generated is too difficult for humans to process.  AI can quickly process this data to make suggestions on new services.  Based on the user profile and other data, AI can offer additional services that are appropriate for the user.
